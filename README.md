# üéÑ **Advent of Cyber 2024** ‚Äì My Cybersecurity Journey

This year‚Äôs **Advent of Cyber 2024** was an incredible experience that gave me the opportunity to tackle real-world cybersecurity challenges and deepen my understanding of core security concepts. Organized by [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com), this event provided 24 hands-on tasks designed to teach practical skills in a fun and approachable way.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Tools I Used**
Participating in the Advent of Cyber exposed me to several powerful tools and platforms, including:
- **Wireshark**: For network packet analysis and investigating suspicious activity.
- **Burp Suite**: To identify and exploit vulnerabilities in web applications.
- **Nmap**: For network discovery and enumeration.
- **Metasploit**: To test and validate exploits in controlled environments.
- **Splunk**: For log analysis and investigating alerts in real-time.
- **OSINT Tools**: To gather actionable intelligence from open sources.
- **John the Ripper**: For cracking passwords and gaining insights into secure hashing practices.

## üß† **Skills and Lessons Learned**
Throughout the event, I developed and refined several key skills that are vital to a successful career in cybersecurity:
1. **Incident Response**: Learned how to analyze logs, detect malicious activity, and provide timely responses to mitigate attacks.
2. **Web Application Security**: Gained hands-on experience in identifying common vulnerabilities like SQL injection and XSS attacks.
3. **Network Analysis**: Enhanced my ability to interpret network traffic and detect potential threats using Wireshark and Nmap.
4. **Privilege Escalation**: Learned how attackers exploit misconfigurations or weaknesses to escalate their privileges on compromised systems.
5. **OSINT Investigations**: Discovered how to gather and analyze publicly available information for threat profiling.
6. **Team Collaboration**: Participated in discussions and knowledge-sharing sessions, simulating the collaborative nature of SOC environments.

## üî• **Favorite Challenge**
One of my favorite challenges involved investigating a simulated phishing attack. It pushed me to:
- Analyze email headers to verify legitimacy.
- Extract artifacts from suspicious files to uncover hidden payloads.
- Use Splunk to track the attacker‚Äôs lateral movements within a simulated environment.

This exercise was not only educational but also gave me a taste of the dynamic problem-solving that cybersecurity professionals face daily.

## üåü **Why This Matters**
Advent of Cyber 2024 has been more than just a series of challenges. It reinforced my passion for cybersecurity and highlighted the importance of a hands-on approach to learning. The event solidified my ability to think critically, adapt to evolving scenarios, and work with industry-standard tools.
